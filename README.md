# DESCRIPTION

The Weather App is a dynamic, full-stack weather forecasting application developed using the MERN stack â€” MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The application integrates the OpenWeather API to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather information for any city in the world. It delivers detailed insights including temperature, humidity, weather conditions, wind speed, and more, through a clean and responsive interface.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of real-time API integration and full-stack development principles in a modern web application. The Weather App not only allows users to search and retrieve real-time weather updates but also stores previous search data (if needed) for history or analytics purposes. Built with a mobile-first approach, the app ensures a consistent experience across all devices.

The backend handles communication with the OpenWeather API and processes the weather data. The frontend is designed with an interactive user interface using React.js, displaying the data in an intuitive and visually appealing format. Together, the system allows seamless fetching, processing, and display of real-time weather information, making it a handy tool for everyday use.
